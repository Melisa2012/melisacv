            <h2>Profile</h2>
            <p>I'm a curious and creative 13-year-old student with a deep passion for programming, writing, and
                shopping. As an aspiring front-end developer, I love bringing ideas to life through code, designing
                visually appealing and user-friendly websites, and continuously exploring new technologies to enhance my
                skills. There's something exciting about solving complex coding challenges, debugging, and refining
                projects to make them better. Every line of code I write is a step toward my goal of mastering web
                development and creating digital experiences that leave an impact.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Writing is another passion of mine, as it allows me to express my creativity, organize my thoughts, and
                communicate ideas effectively. Whether it's crafting stories, writing articles, or documenting my coding
                journey, I enjoy the power of words and how they can inspire, inform, and connect with others.
                Creativity plays a huge role in both my programming and writing, making every project feel like a new
                adventure.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Beyond coding and writing, I have a strong interest in shopping. I love exploring different styles,
                keeping up with the latest fashion and tech trends, and discovering unique items that match my
                personality. Shopping isn't just about buying things; it's about self-expression, finding inspiration,
                and appreciating design and aesthetics in different forms. Whether it’s picking out cool gadgets,
                stylish outfits, or creative accessories, I enjoy the thrill of discovering something new and exciting.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>I'm always eager to learn, improve, and challenge myself in everything I do. My journey as a future
                front-end developer is just beginning, and I’m excited to continue growing, building amazing projects,
                and making a difference in the digital world. With my love for programming, writing, and creativity, I
                look forward to every new challenge that comes my way, ready to embrace opportunities and push my limits
                to achieve my dreams.</p>

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I am currently a dedicated student with a strong focus on programming, writing, and continuous learning.
                My passion for front-end development drives me to explore HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing me to
                build interactive and visually appealing web projects. I enjoy experimenting with new technologies,
                improving my problem-solving skills, and gaining a deeper understanding of how websites function.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Beyond programming, I am also refining my writing skills, learning how to express ideas clearly and
                creatively. Writing helps me communicate effectively, whether it's crafting engaging content,
                documenting my projects, or exploring different forms of storytelling. I believe that strong writing
                skills are just as important as technical knowledge, as they allow me to share my thoughts and ideas
                with clarity and confidence.</p>

            <p>My learning journey is not limited to just school subjects—I actively seek out online resources,
                tutorials, and coding challenges to expand my knowledge. Whether it's practicing algorithms, studying
                design principles, or improving my ability to write clean and efficient code, I am always eager to grow
                and develop new skills. I believe that learning is a lifelong journey, and I am excited to continue
                pushing my boundaries and becoming a skilled front-end developer.</p>
